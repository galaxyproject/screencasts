# The Current History

:::::::{ .spoken .document}
When data is uploaded from your computer or an analysis is done on existing data using Galaxy, each output from those steps generates a dataset. These datasets, and the output datasets from later analysis on them, are stored by Galaxy in Histories.

All users have one <i>current</i> history, which can be thought of as a <b>workspace </b> or a <b>current working directory</b> in bioinformatics terms. Your current history is displayed in the right hand side of the main <i>Analyze Data</i> Galaxy page in what is called the history panel.
The history panel displays output datasets in the order in which they were created, with the oldest/first shown at the bottom. As new analyses are done and new output datasets are generated, the newest datasets are added to the top of the the history panel. In this way, the history panel displays the history of your <b>analysis over time</b>

<b>Users that have registered an account and logged in can have many histories</b> and the history panel allows switching between them and creating new ones. This can be useful to organize different analyses.

<b>Anonymous users</b> (if your Galaxy allows them) are users that have not registered an account. Anonymous users are only allowed one history. On our main, public Galaxy server, users are encouraged to register and log in with the benefit that they can work on many histories and switch between them.

The histories of anonymous users are only associated through your browser's session. So if you close the browser or clear you sessions - <b>that history will be lost!</b> We can not recover it for you if it is.

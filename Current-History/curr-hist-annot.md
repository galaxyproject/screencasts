# Annotating a history

:::::::::{ .spoken .document}
Sometimes tags and names are not enough to describe the work done within a history. Galaxy allows you to create history annotations: longer text entries that allow for more formatting options. The formatting of the text is preserved. Later, if you publish or share the history, the annotation will be displayed automatically, allowing you to share additional notes about the analysis.
To annotate a history, click the annotation button at the top of the history panel. A larger text section will appear displaying any existing annotation, or, if there's none, italic text saying you can click on the control to create an annotation. Click the annotation section. A larger input field will appear. Add your annotations. The <kbd>Enter</kbd> key will move the cursor to the next line. Tabs cannot be entered since the 'Tab' button is used to switch between controls on the page. Tabs can be pasted in however. To save the annotation, click the 'Done' button.

As datasets are added to a history, Galaxy will store them on the server. The total size of these files, for all the datasets in a history, is displayed underneath the history name. For example, if a history has 200 megabytes of dataset data on Galaxy's file system, '200 MB' will be displayed underneath the history name.

If your Galaxy server uses quotas, the total combined size of all your histories will be compared to your quota. If you're using more than the quota allows, Galaxy will prevent you from running any new jobs until you've deleted some datasets and brought that total below the quota.

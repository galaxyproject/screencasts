# Tagging a history

:::::::::{ .spoken .document}
Tags are short pieces of text used to describe the thing they're attached to and many things in Galaxy can be tagged.
Each item can have many tags and you can add new tags or remove them at any time. Tags can be another useful way to organize and search your data. For instance, you might tag a history with the type of analysis you did in it: <i>assembly</i> or <i>variants</i>. Or you may tag them according to data sources or some other metadata: <i>long-term-care-facility</i> or <i>yellowstone park : 2014</i>.

Note that it is recommended to replace spaces in tags with underscores or hyphens. Although spaces are allowed in tags for histories, they are removed from the tags for datasets. To tag a history, click the tag button at the top of the history panel. An input field showing existing tags (if any) or a 'plus' icon will appear. Begin typing your new tag in the field. Any tags that you have used previously will show below your partial entry, allowing you to use this 'autocomplete' data to re-use your previous tags without typing them in full. When you are done, press enter or select one of the previous tags with your arrow keys or mouse. To remove an existing tag, click the small <i>X</i> on the tag or use the backspace key while in the input field.

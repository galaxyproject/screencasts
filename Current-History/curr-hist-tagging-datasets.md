# Tagging datasets

:::::::::{ .spoken .document}
There are two types of tags that can be used as an additional level of labeling for datasets: <b>standard tags</b> and <b>hashtags</b>, also known as <b>name tags</b> or <b>propagating tags</b>. The <b>standard tags</b> work similarly to history tags described above - they add another level of description to datasets making them easier to find.
in A, Tags are added by clicking on the tags icon and entering a name. In B, the tag is used to search the history. Entering <i>microbiome</i> in the search box and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> shows the only dataset containing that tag.
</b>Hashtags</b> are much more powerful as they are <b>displayed</b> in the history panel and <b>propagate</b> through the analysis.  They allow you to more easily track datasets through the analysis. in A, Hashtags are added similarly to standard tags but with one important difference: they are prepended with a hash symbol. in B, you see a history where four starting datasets were given name tags. As the analysis progresses hashtags stay with all datasets that are derived from the initial ones. For example, you can easily see which of the <i>B.W.A.</i> and <i>MarkDuplicates</i> outputs are derived from, say, mother data.
